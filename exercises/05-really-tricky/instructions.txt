GOALS: 
- Create a meal tracking app
- You should use : UITableViewController, UINavigationController, the delegate pattern, NSUserDefaults, the singleton pattern, NSDate, XCodeInterfaceBuilder.
- You are required to look up structures and documentation by yourself too. 

APPLICATION DESCRIPTION:
- The purpose of the app is to let you add a list of things you’ve eaten day by day. 
- The app should have a database of meals references.
- On main screen, you should have a list of dates.
- If you tap on one date, you can see a list of meals, empty or not.
- If you tap on ‘edit’ you can delete an item or add an item at the bottom or edit the item to change it.
- Once done, you can tap on ‘Done’ or not.
- A back button should bring you back to the main screen.
- The back button saves any changes you made on the meal list on that day.

START :
Under .iOS_workshop/exercices/05-really-tricky/really-tricky-exercice/really-tricky-exercice.xcodeproj

INSTRUCTIONS / Hints :
0- Create a meal tracking app
- Start with a simple « Single View application » template

1- Create first screen :
- On the Main storyboard, drag and drop a UITableView item on the view of the ViewController scene
- Connect the tableview’s delegate and dataSource IBOutlets to the ViewController item.
- Rename the ViewController class into DiaryViewController
- On the DiaryViewController.m class, complete the implementation so that :
	_ the tableview display 100 row
	_ the cell display a date in yyyy-MM-dd format
You need to consult the documentation on UITableViewDelegate and UITableViewDataSource protocols.
You need to consult NSDate, NSDateFormatter.
You can have a look at .iOS_workshop/exercices/05-really-tricky/snippets.txt
- Test it.
- Congratulations, you just implemented your first tableview !

2- Create second screen :
- On the Main storyboard, select the DiaryViewController and embed it into a NavigationViewController : Xcode > Editor > Embed in … > Navigation Controller
- On the Main storyboard, drag and drop a new UITableViewController scene. Rename it into DayRecordViewController.
- On the Main storyboard, select this DayRecordViewController, and on the right panel, set its Storyboard ID to ‘dayRecordID’
- On the DiaryViewController.m class, complete the implementation so that if user selects a row, we instantiate a new DayRecordViewController item and then we push it into the current navigationViewController
You can have a look at .iOS_workshop/exercices/05-really-tricky/snippets.txt
- Add a class DayRecordViewController to the project. (File > New > File… > Cocoa Touch > etc.). Make sure that the new class is inherited from UITableViewController. Place it in your projet folder.
- Test it.
- Congratulations, you just implemented your first navigation controller !

Note: Exercise 05 ends here. Next steps are for those who want to dig further on the iOS SDK. 
=====









3- Setup edit mode in second screen
- In the DayRecordViewController, add a private property dayRecordArray array. Initialize it with 5 dummy values at first.
- On the DayRecordViewController, modify the implementation so that :
	_ the tableview displays 5 dummy rows + a dummy row for adding.
	_ the navigationitem’s right bar is set to the current editButtonItem
	_ setup the edit mode (with delete and add) vs the normal mode. 
You need to consult documentation on:
-(void)setEditing:(BOOL)editing animated:(BOOL)animated {
- (UITableViewCellEditingStyle)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView editingStyleForRowAtIndexPath:
- (void)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView commitEditingStyle:(UITableViewCellEditingStyle)editingStyle 
You can have a look at .iOS_workshop/exercices/05-really-tricky/snippets.txt
- Test it.

4- Create 3rd screen :
- Create a new class programmatically. File > New > File… > Cocoa Touch Class.
Make the class inherit from UITableViewController class. Name it MealInventoryTableViewController.
- On the DayRecordViewController, complete the implementation so that :
	_ if user selects a row, another new MealInventoryViewController is created and pushed to the current navigationViewController.
- On the MealInventoryViewController, complete implementation so that :
	_ the tableview displays 6 fixed rows (Bread, Rice, Vegetable, French Fries, Pasta)
	_ when user selects an item, we pop back on the navigationViewController
You need to consult :
[self.navigationController popViewControllerAnimated:YES];

5- Create good data ressources and separation
- Create a MealDatabase class, inherited from NSObject. It should implement the singleton paradigm, and return a static array of meals (mealList) for the MealInventoryViewController to use. 
- Create a UserMealRecordDatabase class, inherited from NSObject. It should have two static public methods :
+ (NSMutableArray*)loadUserMealDataForDay:(NSString*)dayString;
+ (void)saveUserData:(NSArray*)dayRecordData forDay:(NSString*)dayString;
For this exercice, we will use this : [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]   for storing persistent data. You need to consult [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults] documentation to see how to save and retrieve data.

6- Do some glue on data load, display and save.
- In DiaryViewController, add a private property ‘today’ initialized with current date after viewDidLoad.
- In MealInventoryTableViewController, use the mealList provided by the MealDatabase singleton.
- In DayRecordViewController, add a public property « dayString ».
- In DiaryViewController, before pushing DayRecordViewController, pass the day info. 
- In DayRecordViewController, load the array of meal recorded for the day, use it for display
- In MealInventoryTableViewController header, declare a protocol delegate (MealInventoryDelegate) that will pass the selected meal to its parent view controller. 
- Use the MealInventoryDelegate so that : 
	_ DayRecordViewController implements it. 
	_ MealInventoryTableViewController has a property delegate of this type.
	_ before MealInventoryTableViewController is pushed, set its delegate to DayRecordViewController
	_ when a user selects a meal row, use the delegate to pass the selected meal back.
	_ In DiaryViewController’s delegate method implementation, update the days’ record on the correct row. 
- In DayRecordViewController, when the view is about to disappear, save the new record array for the day. 


SOLUTION:
You should find the Xcode project under the ./solution folder.
