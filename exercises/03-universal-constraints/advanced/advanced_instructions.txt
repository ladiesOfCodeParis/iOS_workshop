ADVANCED for those who finished early:

Add other buttons and play with auto-layout constraints so that you have a 3x3 pad of 9 buttons in total.

HINTS:
- use auto-layout for that.
- try to find best combination for both iPad and iPhone at the same time.
- try to find one best combination for iPad and another best combination for iPhone : ask about « size-classes » for that.
